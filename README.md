# SES_Uruguay

This repository is a **work in progress** about analyzing the Socioeconomic Status in Uruguay, using data from a national survey. In frist instance I'm going to try to replicate the classification used by the national institute of statistics, to afterwards do my own clsutering to compare the feature importance in both models.

Done so far:

* Dataset cleaning
* Binarization of some features
* Firsts simple classification models
* Model using new target created out of the income percentiles with ad-hoc function
* PCA to reduce the number of features + modelling
* Some clustering
